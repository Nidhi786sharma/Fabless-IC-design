Welcome Everyone! This open source community is made to gather all the verilog codes so that anyone who is interested in verilog  can found all at one place.

## Let's Contribute

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it]( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).


## Fork this repository
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository
Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```git clone "url you just copied"```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```git clone https://github.com/Nidhi786sharma/Fabless-IC-design.git```

where Your_Username is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the Practical-Files repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch
Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```cd Fabless IC design ```

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

```git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>```

## Add codes, make necessary changes and commit those changes
If you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add . command:

```git add .```

Now commit those changes using the git commit command:

```git commit -m "your message"```

replacing <your-message> with the changes that you've added.

## Push changes to GitHub
Push your changes using the command git push:

```git push origin <add-your-branch-name>```
replacing <add-your-branch-name> with the name of the branch you created earlier.
  
## Submit your changes for review
If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.
Now submit the pull request.

Soon, I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
